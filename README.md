# powerbi
Project for the ERP &amp; BI course at Esprit School of Engineering. It optimizes resource and operations management in an agri-food company using SAP MM &amp; PM, focusing on sustainability, COâ‚‚ reduction, and predictive maintenance.

ðŸ“Š Why Power BI?
In this project, Power BI is used to optimize resource and operations management because:

ðŸ“ˆ 1. Data Visualization and Monitoring
Transform complex data (supplier performance, alert priorities, COâ‚‚ emissions) into clear and interactive dashboards.

Monitor KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like sustainability scores, supplier clustering results, and emission trends in real-time.

Track anomalies easily through visual alerts.

ðŸ§  2. Business Intelligence for Decision Making
Support strategic decisions with data-driven insights (e.g., supplier selection, predictive maintenance planning).

Enable managers to make faster and smarter decisions based on visual trends and predictive analytics outputs.

ðŸ”„ 3. Integration with SAP MM & PM
Connects seamlessly with SAP MM (Materials Management) and SAP PM (Plant Maintenance) data sources.

Automates the update of reports and dashboards directly from SAP transactional data.

ðŸŒ± 4. Focus on Sustainability
Visualize the progress toward sustainability goals (COâ‚‚ reduction, supplier certifications).

Communicate environmental performance clearly to internal teams and external stakeholders.

âš¡ 5. Actionable Predictive Analytics
Display the outputs of Machine Learning models (clustering, classification, time series) in a business-friendly way.

Alert business users when predictive models detect risks or opportunities (e.g., predicting emission spikes, urgent maintenance needs).
